Top-down:


Factions are groups with common political goals. In-game, they have
relations that are non-changing long-term except by storyline
actions. 

The relations are represented with floating-point numbers in a matrix
that may not be symmetric. Negative numbers means hostile relations,
positive means friendly relations, and zero means indifferent. The
larger the number, the more they want to fight each other in space.

Each host of the player will have its own faction. The relations will
be set initially based on where the host came from. For example, if
the host was part of a government, the relations will be the same as
for that government.

In space, there may be a short-lived change of relations if one shoots
the other.  For example, if Faction A hates Faction B, but Faction B
likes Faction A, then Faction B will never shoot first. Once Faction A
shoots Faction B, Faction B will reciprocate. That temporary change in
relations ends once the player leaves the system.

The exception to this is the player's faction, whose relations change
based on combat in the system. If they attack a faction, that
faction's opinion of them will drop permanently.

All of that can be overridden by storyline events.
