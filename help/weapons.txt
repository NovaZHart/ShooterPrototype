@title Magnetic Rail Gun
@price Price:
@synopsis Magnetic fields launch metal objects at extreme velocities.
@content
This cannon uses magnetic fields to accelerate diamagnetic objects near to the speed of light. Most ships carry a reservoir of bullets for this purpose, but nearly any metal object will do.

@title Mass Driver
@price Price:
@synopsis Launches chunks of rock or debris at relativistic velocity using anti-gravity fields.
@content
This enormous gun contains a series of oscillating gravity fields which launch a projectile at extreme velocities. The projectile may be a small asteroid, scrap metal, or even garbage. A dumpster may not sound like much of a threat, until it smashes through your ship's hull at half the speed of light.

@title Misanthrope Anti-Ship Missile
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade ship-to-ship missile intended for medium-sized targets.
@content
This civilian-grade missile is not as smart as most homing weapons, but packs decent damage for a low price.

@PAGE weapons/harpoon_missile
@title Harpoon Anti-Ship Missile
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade ship-to-ship missile intended for medium-sized targets.
@content
This small missile is designed to destroy medium-sized ships. The damage and blast radius are substantial, but the missile cannot maneuver fast enough to keep up with fighters.

@title Anthropomancer Missile
@price Price:
@synopsis High-damage homing missile with a wide blast radius.
@content
This weapon of mass destruction is intended to target large ships or tight groups of small ships. The damage radius is about the size of a capital ship, and it does enough damage to destroy some fighters in one hit. Though it does home in on its target, the missile turns slowly, so it has trouble tracking small ships.

@title Nuclear-Pumped Laser
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade X-ray laser
@content
This weaponized laser uses fission fragments in a small nuclear reactor core to create a high-energy X-ray laser beam. Because it contains its own power source, the power draw of this weapon is minimal, but it generates immense amounts of heat.

@title High-Energy Cyclotron Turret
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade, high-energy, cyclotron, in a turret mount.
@content
This cyclotron uses advanced, military-grade, superconducting, magnets to accelerate particles to relativistic speeds. It fires slower than civilian-grade [ref=weapons/linear_accelerator_turret]Linear Accelerator Turret[/ref], but does far more damage per shot.

@PAGE weapons/he_linear
@title High-Energy Linear Accelerator
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade, high-energy, particle accelerator in a gun mount.
@content
This linear accelerator uses fine-scale anti-gravity fields and powerful magnetic fields to accelerate particles to extreme velocity over a short distance. It does far more damage than civilian-grade weaponry, but with much higher heat and power.

@title Deuterium-Fluoride Laser
@price Price:
@synopsis Low-tech, low-cost, far infrared spectrum, laser
@content
Although this technology is primitive by modern standards, it still sees widespread use because it is cheap to build and maintain.

@title Deuterium-Fluoride Laser Turret
@price Price:
@synopsis Cheap, low-maintenance, laser turret.
@content
This turret is one of the most common anti-fighter weapons due to its low power requirements and low cost of ownership.

@title Gamma Ray Laser
@price Price:
@synopsis A re-purposed industrial laser that does immense damage
@content
Gamma ray lasers are huge instruments that see widespread use in manufacturing and research. Miniaturizing one to fit in a weapon mount is difficult, and the result is expensive to maintain. Battleships with plentiful power and cooling can support several of these weapons.

@PAGE weapons/shockwave_torpedo
@title Shockwave Torpedo
@price Price:
@synopsis Homing torpedo with super-heated chemicals
@content
This gun fires small self-propelled torpedoes with simple guidance systems that home in on a target. Each torpedo a stores two super-heated, highly volatile, chemicals that are so hot no known physical barrier can hold them. Instead, the torpedoes contain them using energy shields. When they reach their target, the containers break, the chemicals mix, and explode with a significant blast radius.

This is the strongest civilian-grade weapon available in human space.
