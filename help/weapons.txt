@title Plasma Ball Launcher
@price Price:
@synopsis Super-heated matter that homes in on your enemies.
@content
Plasma is too hot to contain in any space for more than a few seconds, so this device encases a ball of plasma in an energy shield, connected to some thrusters. The projectiles are unwieldy, but do considerable damage when they hit a target. The heat-to-damage ratio is better than the other Terran plasma weapons, making this a deadly threat to ships that run hot.

@title Plasma Turret
@price Price:
@synopsis Throws super-heated matter at your enemies, overheating their ships.
@content
Beyond the Interstellar Alliance, there are many frontier planets protected by well-armed militias. When the planets lack basic needs, such as food or medicine, militias will raid civilian ships in Interstellar Alliance space. Civilians of the Interstellar Alliance answered this problem with plasma turrets and plasma missiles. A civilian ship can fly away while shooting plasma at the approaching militia ship. Eventually the militia ship will give up, and the civilian can escape.

@title Basic Anti-Missile System
@price Price:
@synopsis Destroys some missiles before they hit your ship.
@content
An anti-missile point-defense system automatically targets incoming missiles, destroying them before they hit your ship. Its firepower is limited, so don't fly into a storm of missiles expecting to survive.

@price Price:
@synopsis Launches chunks of rock or debris at relativistic velocity using anti-gravity fields.
@content
This enormous gun contains a series of oscillating gravity fields which launch a projectile at extreme velocities. The projectile may be a small asteroid, scrap metal, or even garbage. A dumpster may not sound like much of a threat, until it smashes through your ship's hull at half the speed of light.

@PAGE weapons/anthropomancer
@title Anthropomancer Missile
@price Price:
@synopsis High-damage homing missile with a wide blast radius.
@content
This weapon of mass destruction is intended to target large ships or tight groups of small ships. The damage radius is about the size of a capital ship, and it does enough damage to destroy some fighters in one hit. Though it does home in on its target, the missile turns slowly, so it has trouble tracking small ships. In addition to advanced homing abilities, this weapon will contact its ship for a new target if its target is gone.

This smaller cousin of the [ref=weapons/anthropomancer]Anthropomancer Missile[/ref] has the same advanced guidance system in a much smaller package. The blast radius is still quite large, though with less than a third the damage. As with the larger version, it will contact its ship for a new target if the old target is gone.

@synopsis Homing torpedo with super-heated chemicals
@content
This gun fires small self-propelled torpedoes with simple guidance systems that home in on a target. Each torpedo a stores two super-heated, highly volatile, chemicals that are so hot no known physical barrier can hold them. Instead, the torpedoes contain them using energy shields. When they reach their target, the containers break, the chemicals mix, and explode with a significant blast radius.

This is the strongest civilian-grade weapon available in human space.
