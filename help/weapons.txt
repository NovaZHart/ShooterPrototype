@title Linear Accelerator Turret
@synopsis A large weaponized particle accelerator.
@content
This linear particle accelerator uses powerful superconducting magnets to accelerate particles near the speed of light over a very short distance. Though it is much larger than the [ref=weapons/cyclotron_cannon]Cyclotron Cannon[/ref], it fires twice as fast.

@title Deuterium-Fluoride Laser
@synopsis Low-tech, low-cost, far infrared spectrum, laser
@content
Although this technology is primitive by modern standards, it still sees widespread use because it is cheap to build and maintain.

@title Deuterium-Fluoride Laser Turret
@synopsis Cheap, low-maintenance, laser turret.
@content
This turret is one of the most common anti-fighter weapons due to its low power requirements and low cost of ownership.

@title Gamma Ray Laser
@synopsis A re-purposed industrial laser that does immense damage
@content
Gamma ray lasers are huge instruments that see widespread use in manufacturing and research. Miniaturizing one to fit in a weapon mount is difficult, and the result is expensive to maintain. Battleships with plentiful power and cooling can support several of these weapons.

@title Shockwave Torpedo
@synopsis Homing torpedo with super-heated chemicals
@content
This gun fires small self-propelled torpedoes with simple guidance systems that home in on a target. Each torpedo a stores two super-heated, highly volatile, chemicals that are so hot no known physical barrier can hold them. Instead, the torpedoes contain them using energy shields. When they reach their target, the containers break, the chemicals mix, and explode with a significant blast radius.

This is one of the largest and most dangerous weapons produced in human space.

@PAGE weapons/cyclotron_cannon
@title Cyclotron Cannon
@synopsis A weaponized particle accelerator.
@content
This isochronous cyclotron, built from superconducting magnets, has been installed in a gun. It fires bursts of particles near the speed of light, cooling the gun between each burst.
