@title Mass Driver
@price Price:
@synopsis Launches chunks of rock or metal at relativistic velocity using anti-gravity fields.
@content
This enormous gun contains a series of oscillating gravity fields which launch a projectile at extreme velocities. The projectile may be a small asteroid, scrap metal, or even rubbish from the ship. A pile of trash may not sound like much of a threat, until it smashes through your ship's hull at a half the speed of light.

@title Harpoon Anti-Ship Missile
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade ship-to-ship missile intended for medium-sized targets.
@content
This small missile is designed to destroy medium-sized ships. The damage and blast radius are substantial, but the missile cannot maneuver fast enough to keep up with fighters.

@title Nuclear-Pumped Laser
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade X-ray laser
@content
This weaponized laser uses fission fragments in a small nuclear reactor core to create a high-energy X-ray laser beam. Because it contains its own power source, the power draw of this weapon is minimal, but it generates emmense amounts of heat.

@title High-Energy Particle Accelerator
@price Price:
@synopsis Military-grade, high-energy, particle accelerator.
@content
This cyclotron uses advanced, military-grade, superconducting, magnets to accelerate particles to relativistic speeds. It fires slower than civilian-grade [ref=weapons/linear_accelerator_turret]Linear Accelerator Turret[/ref], but does far more damage per shot.

@title Linear Accelerator Turret
@price Price:
@synopsis A large weaponized particle accelerator.
@content
This linear particle accelerator uses powerful superconducting magnets to accelerate particles near the speed of light over a very short distance. Though it is much larger than the [ref=weapons/cyclotron_cannon]Cyclotron Cannon[/ref], it fires twice as fast.

@title Deuterium-Fluoride Laser
@price Price:
@synopsis Low-tech, low-cost, far infrared spectrum, laser
@content
Although this technology is primitive by modern standards, it still sees widespread use because it is cheap to build and maintain.

@title Deuterium-Fluoride Laser Turret
@price Price:
@synopsis Cheap, low-maintenance, laser turret.
@content
This turret is one of the most common anti-fighter weapons due to its low power requirements and low cost of ownership.

@title Gamma Ray Laser
@price Price:
@synopsis A re-purposed industrial laser that does immense damage
@content
Gamma ray lasers are huge instruments that see widespread use in manufacturing and research. Miniaturizing one to fit in a weapon mount is difficult, and the result is expensive to maintain. Battleships with plentiful power and cooling can support several of these weapons.

@title Shockwave Torpedo
@price Price:
@synopsis Homing torpedo with super-heated chemicals
@content
This gun fires small self-propelled torpedoes with simple guidance systems that home in on a target. Each torpedo a stores two super-heated, highly volatile, chemicals that are so hot no known physical barrier can hold them. Instead, the torpedoes contain them using energy shields. When they reach their target, the containers break, the chemicals mix, and explode with a significant blast radius.

This is the strongest civilian-grade weapon available in human space.

@title Cyclotron Cannon
@price Price:
@synopsis A weaponized particle accelerator.
@content
This isochronous cyclotron, built from superconducting magnets, has been installed in a gun. It fires bursts of particles near the speed of light, cooling the gun between each burst.
