@PAGE equipment/adiabatic_demagnetization_cooler
@title Adiabatic Demagnetization Cooler
@price Price:
@synopsis Huge, power-hungry, cooler based on Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration.
@content
Terrans have used adiabatic demagnetization cooling since before the era of interplanetary colonization, but this modern version is the best cooling system available in Terran space. Ship heat is channeled into a "salt pill" of paramagnetic material. When the "salt pill's" entropy is too high, the ship cools it by emitting directional, low-frequency, electromagnetic, radiation. This system takes a substantial amount of energy, but it is 2.5 times more effective per unit space than the next best cooler.

An added advantage of this cooler is its resistance-boosting effect. The cooling system can be used in reverse, absorbing electromagnetic pulses from hostile weapons into the "salt pill," and emitting them harmlessly.

@price Price:
@synopsis Bioengineered algae that can generate and store power.
@content
Bioelectric generators were one of the earliest applications of bioengineering to shipbuilding. They generate a moderate amount of power, store a substantial energy reserve, and emit low levels of heat. This is the smallest bioelectric generator available on modern ships, intended to reduce slight power deficits in ship designs.

Bioelectric generators were one of the earliest applications of bioengineering to shipbuilding. They generate a moderate amount of power, store a substantial energy reserve, and emit low levels of heat. Designers of power-hungry battleships would choose a smaller fusion generator over this massive vat. However, this generator stores a lot more energy and generates far less heat than a similar fusion reactor.

@PAGE equipment/electromagnetic_dampener
@title Electromagnetic Field Dampener
@price Price:
@synopsis Armor and structure resistances: EM Field, Psionic, Light
@content
This device manipulates the conductive properties of your ship's armor to deflect or redistribute incoming electromagnetic fields. This is most effective against large, low-frequency, EM waves (EM Field Damage) but will also dampen Psionic attacks, and reduce light-based damage.

Due to the internal functions of the dampener, it also acts as a battery, albeit less effective than purpose-built energy storage devices. This effect continues even after the armor is gone since the energy is stored in the dampener elements, not the armor itself.

@title Gravity Control System
@price Price:
@synopsis Luxury gravity control and gravity resistance.
@content
A Gravity Control System lets passengers control gravity as easily as controlling a thermostat. They won't feel any ship movements, they can have zero-gravity and high-gravity gyms, and they can adjust gravity to match the planet of their choice. As an added benefit, this will boost armor and structure resistance to gravity-based damage. All ships have built-in artificial gravity, but not nearly as precise or strong as what this system provides.

@content
This Environmental Control System efficiently processes air and pumps it through the ship ventilation system. It controls pressure, temperature, humidity, and the smell and taste of the air. In combat, it will adjust the heat to compensate for any damage from hot matter. It also provides a small amount of cooling.

@PAGE equipment/defensive_scatterer
@title Defensive Scatterer
@price Price:
@synopsis Armor and structure resistances: light, hot matter, psionic.
@content
Lasers are an age-old weapon; cheap to build, low power usage, and cool-running, but they have one major flaw. It is easy to scatter, refract, or reflect light. This device sprays a mist of particles in the direction of any incoming intense light. Light is either refracted away from the ship, or spread across the ship's whole surface, reducing the effect of the weapon. If a ship has one of these devices installed, it has a strong resistance to lasers.

The mist will help against other damage types, to a lesser extent. Hot matter attacks, such as explosions and plasma, will spread out across the mist. The particles in the mist are designed to dampen incoming psionic attacks as well.

@PAGE equipment/ablative_biogel_excreter
@title Ablative Biogel Excreter
@price Price:
@synopsis Armor resistances: hot matter, high-energy particles, light.
@content
This relic of the lost art of City Ship construction is a piece of a City Ship's living hull. It has been genetically programmed to defend against attacks by eating its way across your armor, turning the armor into a heat-resistant paste. The process will destroy some of your armor, but much less than you would have lost without this upgrade. This is most effective against high-energy particles and hot matter such as plasma or explosions. It will reduce damage from light-based weapons to a lesser extent.

The living component of this armor upgrade needs a constant power supply to keep it alive, but it also cools the ship. This effect continues after the armor is gone.

@PAGE equipment/reactive_armor
@title Reactive Armor
@price Price:
@synopsis Armor resistances: antimatter, pierce, impact
@content
This installs ejection mechanisms behind your armor panels. When a projectile is incoming, this system will throw armor panels at it, deflecting it or causing it to activate before it hits your ship. You will still lose armor, but you'll lose much less than without this upgrade. This is extremely effective against antimatter, which will mutually annihilate with the ejected armor plate that hits it. It can deflect matter-based kinetic projectiles less effectively.

The reactive armor upgrade takes no power and generates no heat because it is a passive system. It is entirely mechanical, controlled by the ship's computer and sensors.

@title Cooling and Food Production System
@price Price:
@synopsis Recycles organic waste into food and cools the ship.
@content
This augments a ship's sewage system, converting organic waste back into high-quality food and cold water. The water contains organic particles that turn it into a nanofluid, which is connected to a refrigeration system. Some of the water pipes are directed through hot parts of the ship, allowing this food processor to double as an efficient ship-wide cooling system. The organic nanoparticles are non-toxic, but foul-tasting, so all faucets should have built-in filters. The food, however, is delicious.

Cities on uninhabitable planets use vast arrays of these devices to provide clean water, fertilizer, organic construction components, a vast cooling system, and most of their food. Although people enjoy this processed food, a skilled chef with fresh ingredients can do better. All ships contain minimal waste recycling capabilities to feed crew and passengers, but this device produces city-quality food. Passengers on large starliners expect this luxury.
