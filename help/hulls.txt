@synopsis Capital-class pod hauler.
@content
The only capital-class ship available to civilians, this massive cargo ship carries six cargo pods. It is backed by firepower that can match the largest of raiding vessels. The ship has practically no armor, so captains must rely on its massive shields and structure for defense.

@PAGE hulls/husky
@title Husky Racing Yacht
@price Price:
@synopsis Luxury racing yacht with extra cargo space.
@content
This hull is based on the famous racing vessel, Hellborne Husky. Hellborne Husky's owners leased the design rights to a shipyard who turned it into a durable pleasure yacht. It has luxury quarters for passengers, ample fuel, and plenty of cargo space.  The Husky hull retains enough of its namesake to be the fastest ship in the sky, able to outrun even some missiles.

One of the remarkable technological achievements of this yacht rebuild is its patented, thick, lightweight, armor and hull. Although the armor and structure are less resilient to some damage types, the ship can have far more armor at the same weight. This makes it more durable (and more expensive) than combat ships of its size class, despite its civilian cargo ship classification.

@PAGE hulls/thoroughbred
@title Thoroughbred Starliner
@price Price:
@synopsis Cruiser-sized luxury starliner.
@content
This is a scaled-up version of the [ref=hulls/husky]Husky Racing Yacht[/ref] designed to carry a larger number of passengers. The Husky was a variation on a famous racing vessel, the Hellborne Husky. Thoroughbred is a total redesign with the same design principles. It sacrifices the built-in luxury accomodations for more equipment space to give flexibility in ship outfitting.

The Thoroughbred retains the Husky's patented, thick, lightweight, armor, but has standard hull material. Although the armor is less resilient to some damage types, the ship can have far more armor at the same weight. This makes it more durable (and more expensive) than combat ships of its size class, despite its civilian starliner classification.

@price Price:
@synopsis Fast Cargo Ship

@title Popoto Interceptor Hull
@price Price:
@synopsis Fast military interceptor.
@content
Though most military-grade ships are built much heavier than their civilian counterpart, this design focuses on speed. It is intended to chase down criminal interceptors before they can reach vulnerable civilian craft. The Popoto fuel tank and cargo bay are especially small, so they mainly stay within one system.

@title Ankylorhiza Capital Ship Hull
@price Price:
@synopsis General-purpose, military-grade, capital ship.
@content
Though these massive ships carry a deadly arsenal, they're most often used for peaceful purposes. Navies leverage the Ankylorhiza's huge cargo and personnel capacity for emergency supply transport, mobile hospitals, portable command centers, and transport of high-value cargo. Regardless, any large-scale military campaign will use Ankyloriza's massive spinal-mount cannon against distant targets to deadly effect.

This massive ship is durable by every measure, and focuses on all-round firepower, with five turrets. The forward gun ports are large enough to support all but the largest Terran weapons.
