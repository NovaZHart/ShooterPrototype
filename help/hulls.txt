@title Popoto-Class Interceptor
@price Price:
@synopsis Fast military interceptor.
@content
Though most military-grade ships are built much heavier than their civilian counterpart, this design focuses on speed. It is intended to chase down criminal interceptors before they can reach vulnerable civilian craft. The Popoto fuel tank and cargo bay are especially small, so they mainly stay within one system.

@title Ankylorhiza-Class Warship
@price Price:
@synopsis General-purpose, military-grade, capital ship.
@content
Though these massive ships carry a deadly arsenal, they're most often used for peaceful purposes. Navies leverage the Ankylorhiza's huge cargo and personnel capacity for emergency supply transport, mobile hospitals, portable command ships, and transport of high-value cargo. Regardless, any large-scale military campaign will use Ankyloriza's massive spinal-mount cannon against distant targets to deadly effect.
