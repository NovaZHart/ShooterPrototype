@PAGE engine/hyperdrive
@title Hyperdrive
@price Price:
@synopsis Magnifies thrust in hyperspace.
@content
This hyperdrive collects exotic hypermatter into a reservoir, and sends it into a thruster that ignites it as if it were chemical fuel. Due to the nature of hypermatter, this will not accelerate the ship on its own, but it will increase the acceleration from normal thrusters by 150%. Because hypermatter only exists in hyperspace, this device is useless in normal space.

@PAGE engine/escape_pod_engine
@title Escape Pod Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Tiny thruster and hyperdrive with fuel storage.
@content
This is a standard engine used in most escape pods. It uses a modified hyperdrive that ignites standard chemical propellants in normal space and exotic hypermatter in hyperspace. The thrust in real space is enough for an escape pod, but not much else. In hyperspace, it will increase the thrust of forward and reverse thrusters by 20%. It also stores a small amount of fuel. Although this drive is designed for escape pods, small ships will sometimes use this to boost their hyperspace speed and fuel reserve.

@PAGE engine/plasma_small
@title Small Plasma Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Fuel-less engine for small ships.
@content
This device accelerates plasma near to the speed of light, allowing it to push a ship without storing large amounts of chemical fuel.

@title Medium Plasma Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Standard plasma engine for most ships.
@content
This device accelerates plasma near to the speed of light, allowing it to push a ship without storing large amounts of chemical fuel.

@title Large Plasma Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Massive engine for bulk freighters and battleships.
@content
This device accelerates plasma near to the speed of light, allowing it to push a ship without storing large amounts of chemical fuel.

@PAGE engine/nuclear_fission
@title Mid-Sized Fission Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Nuclear fission engine that produces thrust, power, and extreme heat.
@content
This fission-based power generator accelerates propellant to relativistic velocities. Because it contains its own power generator, it produces power instead of consuming it. The heat generation is so large that you'll need a lot of cooling to offset it. Unfortunately, the propellant cannot be directed, so the engine provides only forward thrust. The power generation is the same as a [ref=equipment/fission_reactor_small]Small Fission Reactor[/ref].

@PAGE engine/nuclear_fusion
@title Large Fusion Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Nuclear fusion engine that produces thrust, power, and extreme heat.
@content
This fusion-based power generator is the most advanced generator, and engine, available to Terran civilians. It accelerates propellant to relativistic velocities, while producing vast amounts of power. You may need multiple cooling systems to offset the extreme heat. Unfortunately, the propellant cannot be directed, so the engine provides only forward thrust. The power generation is the same as a [ref=equipment/fission_reactor_medium]Medium Fission Reactor[/ref].

@PAGE engine/multisystem_small
@title Small maneuvering thrusters.
@price Price:
@synopsis A maneuvering system made of multiple plasma thrusters.
@content
This collection of thrusters uses efficient plasma propellant, similar to standard engines, but propels it in any direction. Instead of providing forward thrust, this gives a ship an enormous boost to its turning thrust, and a moderate boost to its reverse thrust. This is an ideal companion to nuclear engines.
