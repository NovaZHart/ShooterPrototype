@PAGE engine/hyperdrive
@title Hyperdrive
@price Price:
@synopsis Generates enormous thrust in hyperspace.
@content
This hyperdrive collects exotic hypermatter into a reservoir, and sends it into a thruster that ignites it as if it were chemical fuel. Because hypermatter only exists in hyperspace, the drive system is useless in normal space. The boost to your forward and reverse thrust is the same as a [ref=engine/nuclear_fusion]Fusion Engine[/ref], but with almost no heat or energy costs.

@PAGE engine/plasma_small
@title Small Plasma Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Fuel-less engine for small ships.
@content
This device accelerates plasma near to the speed of light, allowing it to push a ship without storing large amounts of chemical fuel.

@PAGE engine/plasma_medium
@title Medium Plasma Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Standard plasma engine for most ships.
@content
This device accelerates plasma near to the speed of light, allowing it to push a ship without storing large amounts of chemical fuel.

@title Large Plasma Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Massive engine for bulk freighters and battleships.
@content
This device accelerates plasma near to the speed of light, allowing it to push a ship without storing large amounts of chemical fuel.

@PAGE engine/nuclear_fission
@title Mid-Sized Fission Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Nuclear fission engine that produces thrust, power, and extreme heat.
@content
This fission-based power generator accelerates propellant to relativistic velocities. Because it contains its own power generator, it produces power instead of consuming it. The heat generation is so large that you'll need a lot of cooling to offset it. Unfortunately, the propellant cannot be directed, so the engine provides only forward thrust. The power generation is the same as a [ref=equipment/fission_reactor_small]Small Fission Reactor[/ref].

@PAGE engine/nuclear_fusion
@title Large Fusion Engine
@price Price:
@synopsis Nuclear fusion engine that produces thrust, power, and extreme heat.
@content
This fusion-based power generator is the most advanced generator, and engine, available to Terran civilians. It accelerates propellant to relativistic velocities, while producing vast amounts of power. You may need multiple cooling systems to offset the extreme heat. Unfortunately, the propellant cannot be directed, so the engine provides only forward thrust. The power generation is the same as a [ref=equipment/fission_reactor_medium]Medium Fission Reactor[/ref].

@PAGE engine/multisystem_small
@title Small maneuvering thrusters.
@price Price:
@synopsis A maneuvering system made of multiple plasma thrusters.
@content
This collection of thrusters uses efficient plasma propellant, similar to standard engines, but propels it in any direction. Instead of providing forward thrust, this gives a ship an enormous boost to its turning thrust, and a moderate boost to its reverse thrust. This is an ideal companion to nuclear engines.
